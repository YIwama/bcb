Sourcecode folders.

- fdbmain : main programs written in C/C++ that implement FDB.
- java : support tools written in Java for pre/post processing of experimental data, etc.

C programs and Java programs are totally separated. No JNI so far.
Serious stuffs in C/C++, quick dirty misc in Java.

Each folder has its project file (cmake/kdevelop files in fdbmain, eclipse projet file in java).
Open them to start development.
