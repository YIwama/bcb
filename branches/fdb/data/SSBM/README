This document describles the SSBM directory layout.

src/dbgen subdirectory 
     contains the SSBM dbgen source code
oracle subdirectory 
     contains sql scripts for loading data to oracle
     database, generating constraints and indexes, performing queries.
sybaseIQ subdirectory 
     will contain similar scripts for sybaseIQ comparing to the oracle.
data subdirectory
     contains the script to generate the data files.

In general, user should compile the SSBM dbgen first and then run
GEN_DATA script in data/ directory to generate all data files. Then
apply scripts in oracle/sybaseIQ for loading data and so on.

Please refer the README files under each directory for details.   

Run on Linux (originally developed on Sun Solaris)  The makefile
in src/dbgen is as used for the Linux run.
